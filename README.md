# Bow is an Apache manager daemon for web developers using Mac OS X
-----
Make the directories on your users Sites directory accessible from apache by using '.dev' tld.

Example: /Users/matrushka/Sites/test will be available as http://test.dev

You do not have to make any configurations like hosts file etc.

Currently under construction. You can dig in to see and make it work but nothing is guaranteed yet.
